# 42 School Projects Test Files 🚀

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of test files for various 42 School projects. These tests are designed to help students verify their code and assist in peer evaluations. 🤝

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: These tests are not officially endorsed by 42 School and may not cover all possible scenarios. Use them as a supplementary tool, not as a definitive measure of project correctness.

## Structure

Each project has its own directory containing relevant test files. All `.c` files are designed to be used independently.

## Important Notes 📝

- These tests are not exhaustive and may not catch all possible errors.
- The code in this repository is not optimized to the fullest extent.
- Always refer to the official project guidelines and requirements.
- Use these tests as a starting point, but don't rely solely on them for project validation.
